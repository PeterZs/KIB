Kinect Instrument Builder - Project for Princeton University Fall 2012 COS597B

Overview
========
The Kinect is a very popular input device for many applications, as diverse as
CAD, to gaming, to music. Many people have made musical instruments using the
Kinect, achieving spectacular results such as the V Motion project. 

KIB makes designing input interactions easy by allowing a user to combine
gestural control widgets during instrument design. During performance, KIB
outputs OSC messages corresponding to the selected gestural control widgets,
so the user can easily use the Kinect with sound synthesis tools such as Max/MSP or ChucK.
